# Process_Set_Generator
Generates a set of k processes with the required CPU cycles they need as well as their memory footprint. Used as a tool for simulating CPU scheduling programs.

# Compile:

    $ gcc main.c

# Execute:

    $ ./a.out k
    (where k is the number of processes to generate)
    
	ex:
    
    $ ./a.out 1000
